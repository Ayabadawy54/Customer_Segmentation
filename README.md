📊 Project Overview:

The goal was to segment customers based on their purchasing behavior using RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis and then apply KMeans clustering to identify distinct customer groups. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

🔍 Step 1: Data Preparation

Collected and cleaned the dataset comprising purchase records.
Ensured data integrity by handling missing values and outliers.

📈 Step 2: RFM Analysis

Recency: Calculated the number of days since the last purchase.
Frequency: Counted the total number of purchases.
Monetary: Summed up the total spend by each customer.

🤖 Step 3: KMeans Clustering

Standardized the RFM values to ensure consistency.
Applied the KMeans algorithm to segment customers into distinct clusters.
Analyzed the resulting clusters to identify key customer segments.

💡 Insights and Results:

Identified high-value customers who are frequent and recent buyers.
Recognized customers with high potential for re-engagement.
Provided actionable recommendations for targeted marketing strategies.

🛠️ Step 4: Predictive Modeling

Developed a predictive model to classify new customers into the identified clusters.
Utilized historical data to train the model, enhancing its accuracy and reliability.
